# digiYiiKam
Web frontend for the famous open-source software DigiKam Photo Management

# Requirements
| Component    | Software    |
| --- | --- |
| OS  | Linux or MAC with PHP support |
| Database | MySQL or MariaDB |

digiYiiKam uses the Yii2-Framework and was tested with DigiKam running with MySQL. 

## SQLite support 
SQLite should also work, but is not tested. digiYiiKam must have access to the database file from DigiKam.

## Read access to photo collection(s)
Be sure, that the Apache or web server user (e.g. www-data on Debian, Ubuntu, ...) has read-access to the image files.
